L. Members are advised to log on to the TTM website regularly in order to get better results soon. While browsing the TTM Website/App, members are advised to strictly abide by the terms & conditions of the TTM Website / App. Members can use our Horoscope matching and Background verifying (BGV) services if required. These services are pay & avail optional services. It is up to the sole discretion of the Members / Registrants to avail these optional services. These services are provided by third party vendors, hence, TTM can’t be held responsible if any undesirable outcome emerges (as the discreet BGV is only a primary report of the prospect’s family reputation, character, status etc. which, sometimes, may not be the real picture. But it will definitely give you a basic idea of the prospect’s background). TTM does not insist any of these to its members.

Horoscope & BGV services would help you fix your prospective profile at the initial stage. But it is the responsibility of the Members to cross-check / verify the complete background of the prospects before finalizing on a prospect.
You can seek the support of our Astrologers for the initial horoscope match checking process, so that you can select the Horoscope matching prospects for further talks.
Similarly, you can get the support of our third-party BGV Vendor for verification of a prospect’s 1. Residence Address (discreet verification) 2. Employment Verification & 3. Education (genuineness) Verification.
Unlike Bank’s credit verification procedure, Matrimonial BGV will be done very discreetly. For instance, 1. Residence address verification will be carried out with the neighbours of the prospect’s house (as a relative of the Member) to “ascertain the reputation of their family, duration of stay, ownership status & to gather any other available details that can be useful for the Member to decide on that prospect”  2. Employment Verification will be done directly with the prospect’s employer (as he/she furnished in their profile information) in order to cross check his/her current position, remuneration & conduct of the prospect. Line wise, 3. Education verification will be carried out at the last studied institution of the prospect as  he/she furnished in his/her profile and be ascertained the conduct & genuineness of the education of the prospect in that institution while he/she was studying there.
